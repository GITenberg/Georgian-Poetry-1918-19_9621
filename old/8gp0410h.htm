not interfered with the writing of good poetry.<br>

<br>
<h3><i>Witchcraft: New Style</i></h3>

<blockquote>The sun drew off at last his piercing fires.<br>
Over the stale warm air, dull as a pond<br>
And moveless in the grey quieted street,<br>
Blue magic of a summer evening glowed.<br>
The sky, that had been dazzling stone all day,<br>
Hollowed in smooth hard brightness, now dissolved<br>
To infinite soft depth, and smoulder'd down<br>
Low as the roofs, dark burning blue, and soared<br>
Clear to that winking drop of liquid silver,<br>
The first exquisite star. Now the half-light<br>
Tidied away the dusty litter parching<br>
Among the cobbles, veiled in the colour of distance<br>
Shabby slates and brickwork mouldering, turn'd<br>
The hunchback houses into patient things<br>
Resting; and golden windows now began.<br><br>

A little brisk grey slattern of a woman,<br>
Pattering along in her loose-heel'd clogs,<br>
Pushed the brass-barr'd door of a public-house;<br>
The spring went hard against her; hand and knee<br>
Shoved their weak best. As the door poised ajar,<br>
Hullabaloo of talking men burst out,<br>
A pouring babble of inflamed palaver,<br>
And overriding it and shouted down<br>
High words, jeering or downright, broken like<br>
Crests that leap and stumble in rushing water.<br>
Just as the door went wide and she stepped in,<br>
'She cannot do it!' one was bawling out:<br>
A glaring hulk of flesh with a bull's voice.<br>
He finger'd with his neckerchief, and stretched<br>
His throat to ease the anger of dispute,<br>
Then spat to put a full stop to the matter.<br><br>

The little woman waited, with one hand<br>
Propping the door, and smiled at the loud man.<br>
They saw her then; and the sight was enough<br>
To gag the speech of every drinker there:<br>
The din fell down like something chopt off short.<br>
Blank they all wheel'd towards her, with their mouths<br>
Still gaping as though full of voiceless words.<br>
She let the door slam to; and all at ease,<br>
Amused, her smile wrinkling about her eyes,<br>
Went forward: they made room for her quick enough.<br>
Her chin just topt the counter; she gave in<br>
Her bottle to the potboy, tuckt it back,<br>
Full of bright tawny ale, under her arm,<br>
Rapt down the coppers on the planisht zinc,<br>
And turned: and no word spoken all the while.<br><br>

The first voice, in that silent crowd, was hers,<br>
Her light snickering laugh, as she stood there<br>
Pausing, scanning the sawdust at her feet.<br>
Then she switcht round and faced the positive man<br>
Whose strong 'She cannot do it!' all still felt<br>
Huskily shouting in their guilty ears.<br><br>

'She can't, eh? She can't do it? ' &mdash; Then she'd heard!<br><br>

The man, inside his ruddy insolent flesh,<br>
Had hoped she did not hear. His barrel chest<br>
Gave a slight cringe, as though the glint of her eyes<br>
Prickt him. But he stood up to her awkwardly bold,<br>
One elbow on the counter, gripping his mug<br>
Like a man holding on to a post for safety.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Man:</i>

<blockquote>You can't do what's not nature: nobody can.</blockquote><br>


<i>The Woman:</i><blockquote> And louts like you have nature in your pocket?</blockquote><br>


<i>The Man:</i>

<blockquote>I don't say that &mdash; </blockquote><br>


<i>The Woman:</i> <blockquote>If you kept saying naught, No one would guess the fool you are.</blockquote><br>


<i>Second Man:</i>

<blockquote>       Almost <br>
  My very words!</blockquote><br>

<i>The Woman:</i>

<blockquote>O you're the knowing man! <br>
  The spark among the cinders!</blockquote><br>

<i>First Man:</i>

<blockquote>                      You can't fetch <br>
  A free man back, unless he wants to come.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Woman:</i>

<blockquote>Nay, I'll be bound he doesn't want to come!</blockquote><br>

<i>Third Man: </i>

<blockquote>And he won't come: he told me flat he wouldn't.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Woman:</i>

<blockquote>Are you there too?</blockquote><br>

<i>Third Man:</i>

<blockquote>And if he does come back <br>
  It will be devilry brought him.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Woman:</i>

<blockquote>I shall bring him; &mdash; <br>
Tonight.</blockquote><br>

<i>First Man:</i>

<blockquote>How will he come?</blockquote><br>

<i>The Woman:</i>

<blockquote>Running: unless <br>
  He's broke his leg, and then he'll have to come <br>
  Crawling: but he will come.</blockquote><br>

<i>First Man:</i>

<blockquote>How do you know <br>
  What he may choose to do, three counties off?</blockquote><br>


<i>The Woman:</i>

<blockquote>He choose?</blockquote><br>

<i>Third Man:</i>

<blockquote>You haven't got him on a lead.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Woman:</i>

<blockquote>Haven't I though!</blockquote><br>

<i>Second Man:</i>

<blockquote>That's right; it's what I said.</blockquote><br>


<i>The Woman:</i>

<blockquote>Ay, there are brains in your family.</blockquote><br>

<i>First Man:</i>

<blockquote>You have <br>
  Some sort of pull on him, to draw him home?</blockquote><br>



<i>The Woman:</i>

 <blockquote> You may say that: I have hold of his mind.<br>
  And I can slack it off or fetch it taut.<br>
  And make him dance a score of miles away<br>
  An answer to the least twangling thrum<br>
  I play on it. He thought he lurkt at last<br>
  Safely; and all the while, what has he been?<br>
  An eel on the end of a night line; and it's time<br>
  I haul'd him in. You'll see, to-night I'll land him.</blockquote><br>

<i>Third Man:</i>

<blockquote>Bragging's a light job.</blockquote><br>



<i>The Woman:</i>

<blockquote>You daren't let me take<br>
Your eyes in mine! &mdash; Haul, did I say? no need:<br>
I give his mind a twitch, and up he comes<br>
Tumbling home to me. Whatever work he's at,<br>
He drops the thing he holds like redhot iron<br>
And runs &mdash; runs till he falls down like a beast<br>
Pole-axt, and grunts for breath; then up and on,<br>
No matter does he know the road or not:<br>
The strain I put on his mind will keep him going<br>
Right as a homing-pigeon.</blockquote><br>

<i>First Man: </i>

<blockquote>Devilry I call it.</blockquote><br>


<i>The Woman:</i>

<blockquote>And you're welcome.</blockquote><br>

<i>Second Man:</i>

<blockquote>But the law should have a say here.</blockquote><br>


<i>The Woman:</i>

<blockquote>  What, isn't he mine,<br>
  My own? There's naught but what I please about it.</blockquote><br>

<i>Third Man: </i>

<blockquote>Why did you let him go?</blockquote><br>


<i>The Woman:</i>

<blockquote>To fetch him back!<br>
For I enjoy this, mind. There's many a one<br>
Would think, to see me, There goes misery!<br>
There's a queer starveling for you! &mdash; and I do<br>
A thing that makes me like a saint in glory,<br>
The life of me the sound of a great tune<br>
Your flesh could never hear: I can send power<br>
Delighting out of me! O, the mere thought<br>
Has made my blood go smarting in my veins,<br>
Such a flame glowing along it! &mdash; And all the same<br>
I'll pay him out for sidling off from me.<br>
But I'll have supper first.</blockquote><br>


<blockquote>                          When she was gone,      <br>
Their talk could scarcely raise itself again<br>
Above a grumble. But at last a cry<br>
Sharp-pitcht came startling in from the street: at once<br>
Their moody talk exploded into flare<br>
Of swearing hubbub, like gunpowder dropt<br>
On embers; mugs were clapt down, out they bolted<br>
Rowdily jostling, eager for the event.<br><br>

All down the street the folk throng'd out of doors,<br>
But left a narrow track clear in the middle;<br>
And there a man came running, a tall man<br>
Running desperately and slowly, pounding<br>
Like a machine, so evenly, so blindly;<br>
And regularly his trotting body wagg'd.<br>
Only one foot clatter'd upon the stones;<br>
The other padded in his dogged stride:<br>
The boot was gone, the sock hung frayed in shreds<br>
About his ankle, the foot was blood and earth;<br>
And never a limp, not the least flinch, to tell<br>
The wounded pulp hit stone at every step.<br>
His clothes were tatter'd and his rent skin showed,<br>
Harrowed with thorns. His face was pale as putty,<br>
Thrown far back; clots of drooping spittle foamed<br>
On his moustache, and his hair hung in tails,<br>
Mired with sweat; and sightless in their sockets<br>
His eyeballs turned up white, as dull as pebbles.<br>
Evenly and doggedly he trotted,<br>
And as he went he moaned. Then out of sight<br>
Round a corner he swerved, and out of hearing.<br>
<br>
 &mdash; 'The law should have a say to that, by God!'</blockquote>

(<i>To J. S. and A. W. S.</i>)<br>
<br>

<blockquote>In entering the town, where the bright river<br>
Shrinks in its white stone bed, old thoughts return<br>
Of how a quiet queen was nurtured here<br>
In the pale, shadowed ruin on the height;<br>
Of how, when the hoar town was new and clean<br>
And had not grown a part of the gaunt fells<br>
That peered down into it, the burghers wove<br>
On their small, fireside looms green, famous webs<br>
To cling on lissome, tower-dwelling ladies<br>
Who rode the hills swaying like green saplings,<br>
Or mask tall, hardy outlaws from pursuit<br>
Down beechen caverns and green under-lights,<br>
(The rude, vain looms are gone, their beams are broken;<br>
Their webs are now not seen, but memory<br>
Still tangles in their mesh the dews they swept<br>
Like ruby sparks, the lights they took, the scents<br>
They held, the movement of their shapes and shades);<br>
Of how the Border burners in cold dawns<br>
Of Summer hurried North up the high vales<br>
Past smoking farmsteads that had lit the night<br>
And surf of crowding cattle; and of how<br>
A laughing prince of cursed, impossible hopes<br>
Rode through the little streets Northward to battle<br>
And to defeat, to be a fading thought,<br>
Belated in dead mountains of romance.<br><br>

A carver at his bench in a high gable<br>
Hears the sharp stream close under, far below<br>
Tinkle and rustle, and no other sound<br>
Arises there to him to change his thoughts<br>
Of the changed, silent town and the dead hands<br>
That made it and maintained it, and the need<br>
For handiwork and happy work and work<br>
To use and ease the mind if such sweet towns<br>
Are to be built again or live again.<br><br>

The long town ends at Littleholme, where the road<br>
Creeps up to hills of ancient-looking stone.<br>
Under the hanging eaves at Littleholme<br>
A latticed casement peeps above still gardens<br>
Into a crown of druid-solemn trees<br>
Upon a knoll as high as a small house,<br>
A shapely mound made so by nameless men<br>
Whose smoothing touch yet shows through the green hide.<br>
When the slow moonlight drips from leaf to leaf<br>
Of that sharp, plumy gloom, and the hour comes<br>
When something seems awaited, though unknown,<br>
There should appear between those leaf-thatched piles<br>
Fresh, long-limbed women striding easily,<br>
And men whose hair-plaits swing with their shagged arms;<br>
Returning in that equal, echoed light<br>
Which does not measure time to the dear garths<br>
That were their own when from white Norway coasts<br>
They landed on a kind, not distant shore,<br>
And to the place where they have left their clothing,<br>
Their long-accustomed bones and hair and beds<br>
That once were pleasant to them, in that barrow<br>
Their vanished children heaped above them dead:<br>
For in the soundless stillness of hot noon<br>
The mind of man, noticeable in that knoll,<br>
Enhances its dark presence with a life<br>
More vivid and more actual than the life<br>
Of self-sown trees and untouched earth. It is seen <br>
What aspect this land had in those first eyes:<br>
In that regard the works of later men<br>
Fall in and sink like lime when it is slaked,<br>
Staid, youthful queen and weavers are unborn,<br>
And the new crags the Northmen saw are set<br>
About an earth that has not been misused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Whither, O, my sweet mistress, must I follow thee? <br>
  For when I hear thy distant footfall nearing,<br>
  And wait on thy appearing,<br>
Lo! my lips are silent: no words come to me.<br><br>

Once I waylaid thee in green forest covers,<br>
  Hoping that spring might free my lips with gentle fingers;<br>
  Alas! her presence lingers      <br>
No longer than on the plain the shadow of brown kestrel hovers.<br><br>

Through windless ways of the night my spirit followed after;<br>
  Cold and remote were they, and there, possessed<br>
  By a strange unworldly rest,<br>
Awaiting thy still voice heard only starry laughter.<br><br>

The pillared halls of sleep echoed my ghostly tread.<br>
  Yet when their secret chambers I essayed<br>
  My spirit sank, dismayed,<br>
Waking in fear to find the new-born vision fled.<br><br>

Once indeed &mdash; but then my spirit bloomed in leafy rapture &mdash; <br>
  I loved; and once I looked death in the eyes:<br>
  So, suddenly made wise,<br>
Spoke of such beauty as I may never recapture....<br><br>

Whither, O, divine mistress, must I then follow thee?<br>
  Is it only in love ... say, is it only in death<br>
  That the spirit blossometh,<br>
And words that may match my vision shall come to me?</blockquote><br>

  Let us go into the garden now that the sky is cool;<br>
The garden of black hellebore and rosemary,<br>

Low we passed in the twilight, for the wavering heat<br>
  Of day had waned; and round that shaded plot<br>
Of secret beauty the thickets clustered sweet:<br>
  Here is heaven, our hearts whispered, but our lips spake not.<br><br>

Between that old garden and seas of lazy foam<br>
  Gloomy and beautiful alleys of trees arise<br>
With spire of cypress and dreamy beechen dome,<br>
  So dark that our enchanted sight knew nothing but the skies:<br><br>

Veiled with a soft air, drench'd in the roses' musk<br>
  Or the dusky, dark carnation's breath of clove:<br>
No stars burned in their deeps, but through the dusk<br>
  I saw my love's eyes, and they were brimmed with love.<br><br>

No star their secret ravished, no wasting moon<br>
  Mocked the sad transience of those eternal hours:<br>
Only the soft, unseeing heaven of June,<br>
  The ghosts of great trees, and the sleeping flowers.<br><br>

For doves that crooned in the leafy noonday now<br>
  Were silent; the night-jar sought his secret covers,<br>
Nor even a mild sea-whisper moved a creaking bough &mdash; <br>
  Was ever a silence deeper made for lovers?<br><br>

Was ever a moment meeter made for love?     <br>
  Beautiful are your closed lips beneath my kiss;  <br>

And men who starve on Lettermore,<br>

And wide seas tarnish in the sun.     <br><br>

And so you'll think of Lettermore<br>
As a lost island of the blest:<br>
With peasant lovers in a blue<br>
Dim dusk, with heather drench'd in dew,<br>
And the sweet peace of Lettermore<br>
Remote and dreaming in the West.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>Before my window, in days of winter hoar   <br>
Huddled a mournful wood:<br>
Smooth pillars of beech, domed chestnut, sycamore,<br>
In stony sleep they stood:<br>
But you, unhappy elm, the angry west<br>
Had chosen from the rest,<br>
Flung broken on your brothers' branches bare,<br>
And left you leaning there<br>
So dead that when the breath of winter cast<br>
Wild snow upon the blast,<br>
The other living branches, downward bowed,<br>
Shook free their crystal shroud<br>
And shed upon your blackened trunk beneath<br>
Their livery of death....<br><br>

On windless nights between the beechen bars<br>
I watched cold stars<br>
Throb whitely in the sky, and dreamily<br>
Wondered if any life lay locked in thee:<br>
If still the hidden sap secretly moved<br>
As water in the icy winterbourne <br>
Floweth unheard:<br>
And half I pitied you your trance forlorn:<br>
You could not hear, I thought, the voice of any bird,<br>
The shadowy cries of bats in dim twilight<br>
Or cool voices of owls crying by night ...<br>
Hunting by night under the hornéd moon:<br>
Yet half I envied you your wintry swoon,<br>
Till, on this morning mild, the sun, new-risen<br>
Steals from his misty prison;<br>
The frozen fallows glow, the black trees shaken<br>
In a clear flood of sunlight vibrating awaken:<br>
And lo, your ravaged bole, beyond belief<br>
Slenderly fledged anew with tender leaf<br>
As pale as those twin vanes that break at last<br>
In a tiny fan above the black beech-mast<br>
Where no blade springeth green<br>
But pallid bells of the shy helleborine.<br>
What is this ecstasy that overwhelms<br>
The dreaming earth? See, the embrownéd elms<br>
Crowding purple distances warm the depths of the wood:<br>
A new-born wind tosses their tassels brown,<br>
His white clouds dapple the down:<br>
Into a green flame bursting the hedgerows stand.<br>
Soon, with banners flying, Spring will walk the land....<br><br>

There is no day for thee, my soul, like this,<br>
No spring of lovely words. Nay, even the kiss<br>
Of mortal love that maketh man divine<br>
This light cannot outshine:<br>
Nay, even poets, they whose frail hands catch<br>
The shadow of vanishing beauty, may not match<br>
This leafy ecstasy. Sweet words may cull<br>
Such magical beauty as time may not destroy;<br>
But we, alas, are not more beautiful:<br>
We cannot flower in beauty as in joy.<br>
We sing, our muséd words are sped, and then<br>
Poets are only men<br>
Who age, and toil, and sicken.... This maim'd tree<br>
May stand in leaf when I have ceased to be.</blockquote>

In their sockets our eyes are still;<br>
Desire as cold as the dead;<br>
Without wonder or will.<br><br>

And One, with a lanthorn, draws near,<br>
At clash with the moon in our eyes:<br>
'Where art thou?' he asks: 'I am here,'<br>
One by one we arise.<br><br>

And none lifts a hand to withhold<br>
A friend from the touch of that foe:<br>
Heart cries unto heart, 'Thou art old!'<br>

Treading as in jungles free leopards do,<br>
Printless as evelight, instant as dew.<br>

Delicate and far their counsels wild,<br>

Beautiful flocks of the mind.</blockquote>

There is no sound at the top of the house of men<br>

They are lying in rows there, under the gloomy beams;<br>
On the sagging floor; they gather the silver streams<br>
Out of the moon, those moonlit apples of dreams,<br>

In the corridors under there is nothing but sleep.<br>
And stiller than ever on orchard boughs they keep<br>
Tryst with the moon, and deep is the silence, deep<br>

Empty; a walled-in silence, in this twilight of May &mdash; <br>
Home for lovers, and friendly withdrawing, and sleep,<br>
With none to love there, nor laugh, nor climb from the day<br>
To the candles and linen ... Yet in the silence creep,<br>
This minute, I know, little ghosts, little virtuous lives,<br>
Breathing upon that still, insensible place,<br>
Touching the latches, sorting the napkins and knives,<br>
And such for the comfort of being, and bowls for the grace,<br>
That roses will brim; they are creeping from that room to this,<br>
One room, and two, till the four are visited ... they,<br>

Of travelling lovers to Cotswold, signs of an hour,<br>
Very soon, when up from the valley in June will ride<br>
Lovers by Lynch to Oakridge up in the wide<br>
Bow of the hill, to a garden of lavender flower ...<br>

In that warm ferny hollow where the sun<br>
Slants one gold beam and no light else but thine<br>

<blockquote>When I had dreamed and dreamed what woman's beauty was,<br>
And how that beauty seen from unseen surely flowed,<br>
I turned and dreamed again, but sleeping saw no more:<br>
My eyes shut and my mind with inward vision glowed.<br><br>

'I did not think!' I cried, seeing that wavering shape<br>
That steadied and then wavered, as a cherry bough in June<br>
Lifts and falls in the wind &mdash; each fruit a fruit of light;<br>
And then she stood as clear as an unclouded moon.<br><br>

As clear and still she stood, moonlike remotely near;<br>
I saw and heard her breathe, I years and years away.<br>
Her light streamed through the years, I saw her clear and still,<br>
Shape and spirit together mingling night with day.<br><br>

Water falling, falling with the curve of time<br>
Over green-hued rock, then plunging to its pool<br>
Far, far below, a falling spear of light;<br>
Water falling golden from the sun but moonlike cool:<br><br>

Water has the curve of her shoulder and breast,<br>
Water falls as straight as her body rose,<br>
Water her brightness has from neck to still feet,<br>
Water crystal-cold as her cold body flows.<br><br>

But not water has the colour I saw when I dreamed,<br>
Nor water such strength has. I joyed to behold<br>
How the blood lit her body with lamps of fire<br>
And made the flesh glow that like water gleamed cold,<br><br>

A flame in her arms and in each finger flame,<br>
And flame in her bosom, flame above, below,<br>
The curve of climbing flame in her waist and her thighs;<br>
From foot to head did flame into red flame flow.<br><br>

I knew how beauty seen from unseen must rise,<br>
How the body's joy for more than body's use was made.<br>
I knew then how the body is the body of the mind,<br>
And how the mind's own fire beneath the cool skin played.<br><br>

O shape that once to have seen is to see evermore,<br>
Falling stream that falls to the deeps of the mind,<br>
Fire that once lit burns while aught burns in the world,<br>
Foot to head a flame moving in the spirit's wind!<br><br>

If these eyes could see what these eyes have not seen &mdash; <br>
The inward vision clear &mdash; how should I look, for joy,<br>
Knowing that beauty's self rose visible in the world<br>
Over age that darkens, and griefs that destroy?</blockquote>

With crests of shriller scarlet flying<br>

Of other worlds I cannot tell<br>
Flashes that screeching strife;<br>

Sing through my blood and set my heart replying<br>
And jangling like a bell.</blockquote><br><br>

He saw them, seven solemn negroes dancing,<br>
With faces rapt and out-thrust bellies prancing<br>
In a slow solemn ceremonial cakewalk,<br>
Dancing and prancing to the sombre tom-tom<br>
Thumped by a crookbacked grizzled negro squatting.<br>
And as he watched ... within the steamy twilight<br>
Of swampy forest in rank greenness rotting,<br>
That sombre tom-tom at his heartstrings strumming<br>
Set all his sinews twitching, and a singing<br>
Of cold fire through his blood &mdash; and he was dancing<br>
Among his fellows in the dank green twilight<br>
With naked, oiled, bronze-gleaming bodies swinging<br>
In a rapt holy everlasting cakewalk<br>
For evermore in slow procession prancing.</blockquote>

The golden birds; and out of silence, song.</blockquote>

<h3>A Ballad of Nursery Rhyme</h3>

<blockquote>Strawberries that in gardens grow<br>
  Are plump and juicy fine,<br>
But sweeter far as wise men know<br>
  Spring from the woodland vine.<br><br>

No need for bowl or silver spoon,<br>
  Sugar or spice or cream,<br>
Has the wild berry plucked in June<br>
  Beside the trickling stream.<br><br>

One such to melt at the tongue's root,<br>
  Confounding taste with scent,<br>
Beats a full peck of garden fruit:<br>
  Which points my argument.<br><br>

May sudden justice overtake<br>
  And snap the froward pen,<br>
That old and palsied poets shake<br>
  Against the minds of men;<br><br>

Blasphemers trusting to hold caught<br>
  In far-flung webs of ink<br>
The utmost ends of human thought,<br>
  Till nothing's left to think.<br><br>

But may the gift of heavenly peace<br>
  And glory for all time<br>
Keep the boy Tom who tending geese<br>
  First made the nursery rhyme.<br><br>

By the brookside one August day,<br>
  Using the sun for clock,<br>
Tom whiled the languid hours away<br>
  Beside his scattering flock,<br><br>

Carving with a sharp pointed stone<br>
  On a broad slab of slate<br>
The famous lives of Jumping Joan,<br>
  Dan Fox and Greedy Kate;<br><br>

Rhyming of wolves and bears and birds,<br>
  Spain, Scotland, Babylon,<br>
That sister Kate might learn the words<br>
  To tell to Toddling John.<br><br>

But Kate, who could not stay content<br>
  To learn her lesson pat,<br>
New beauty to the rough lines lent<br>
  By changing this or that;<br><br>

And she herself set fresh things down<br>
  In corners of her slate,<br>
Of lambs and lanes and London Town.<br>
  God's blessing fall on Kate!<br><br>

The baby loved the simple sound,<br>
  With jolly glee he shook,<br>
And soon the lines grew smooth and round<br>
  Like pebbles in Tom's brook,<br><br>

From mouth to mouth told and retold<br>
  By children sprawled at ease<br>
Before the fire in winter's cold,<br>
  In June beneath tall trees;<br><br>

Till though long lost are stone and slate,<br>
  Though the brook no more runs,<br>
And dead long time are Tom, John, Kate,<br>
  Their sons and their sons' sons;<br><br>

Yet, as when Time with stealthy tread <br>
  Lays the rich garden waste, <br>
The woodland berry ripe and red<br>
  Fails not in scent or taste,<br><br>

So these same rhymes shall still be told<br>
  To children yet unborn,<br>
While false philosophy growing old<br>
  Fades and is killed by scorn.</blockquote>

<a name="beatdrow"></a><h3>The Voice of Beauty Drowned</h3>
<br>
<blockquote><i>Cry from the thicket my heart's bird!</i><br>
The other birds woke all around;<br>
Rising with toot and howl they stirred<br>
Their plumage, broke the trembling sound,<br>
They craned their necks, they fluttered wings,<br>
'While we are silent no one sings,<br>
And while we sing you hush your throat,<br>
Or tune your melody to our note.'<br><br>

<i>Cry from the thicket my heart's bird!</i><br>
The screams and hootings rose again:<br>
They gaped with raucous beaks, they whirred<br>
Their noisy plumage; small but plain<br>
The lonely hidden singer made<br>
A well of grief within the glade.<br>
'Whist, silly fool, be off,' they shout,<br>
'Or we'll come pluck your feathers out.'<br><br>

<i>Cry from the thicket my heart's bird!</i><br>
Slight and small the lovely cry<br>
Came trickling down, but no one heard;<br>
Parrot and cuckoo, crow, magpie,<br>
Jarred horrid notes, the jangling jay<br>
Ripped the fine threads of song away;<br>
For why should peeping chick aspire<br>
To challenge their loud woodland choir?<br><br>

Cried it so sweet, that unseen bird?<br>
Lovelier could no music be,<br>
Clearer than water, soft as curd,<br>
Fresh as the blossomed cherry tree.<br>
How sang the others all around?<br>
Piercing and harsh, a maddening sound,<br>
With <i>Pretty Poll, Tuwit-tuwoo<br>
Peewit, Caw Caw, Cuckoo-Cuckoo.</i><br><br>

How went the song, how looked the bird?<br>
If I could tell, if I could show<br>
With one quick phrase, one lightning word,<br>
I'd learn you more than poets know;<br>
For poets, could they only catch<br>
Of that forgotten tune one snatch,<br>
Would build it up in song or sonnet,<br>
And found their whole life's fame upon it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is a wild land, country of my choice,<br>
  With harsh craggy mountain, moor ample and bare.<br>
Seldom in these acres is heard any voice<br>
  But voice of cold water that runs here and there<br>
  Through rocks and lank heather growing without care.<br>
No mice in the heath run nor no birds cry<br>
For fear of the dark speck that floats in the sky.<br><br>

He soars and he hovers rocking on his wings,<br>
  He scans his wide parish with a sharp eye,<br>
He catches the trembling of small hidden things,<br>
  He tears them in pieces dropping from the sky:<br>
  Tenderness and pity the land will deny,<br>
Where life is but nourished from water and rock,<br>
A hardy adventure, full of fear and shock.<br><br>

Time has never journeyed to this lost land,<br>
  Crakeberries and heather bloom out of date,<br>
The rocks jut, the streams flow singing on either hand,<br>
  Careless if the season be early or late.<br>
  The skies wander overhead, now blue now slate:<br>
Winter would be known by his cold cutting snow<br>
If June did not borrow his armour also.<br><br>

Yet this is my country beloved by me best,<br>
 The first land that rose from Chaos and the Flood,<br>
Nursing no fat valleys for comfort and rest,<br>
  Trampled by no hard hooves, stained with no blood<br>
  Bold immortal country whose hill-tops have stood<br>
Strongholds for the proud gods when on earth they go,<br>
Terror for fat burghers in far plains below.</blockquote>

Come, I will consecrate you for the journey.<br><br>

Rather I had you would not go. Nay come,<br>
I will not again reproach you. Lie back<br>
And let me love you a long time ere you go.<br>
For you are sullen-hearted still, and lack<br>
The will to love me. But even so<br>
I will set a seal upon you from my lip,<br>
Will set a guard of honour at each door,<br>
Seal up each channel out of which might slip<br>
Your love for me.<br><br>

                   I kiss your mouth. Ah, love,<br>
Could I but seal its ruddy, shining spring<br>
Of passion, parch it up, destroy, remove<br>
Its softly-stirring, crimson welling-up<br>
Of kisses! Oh, help me, God! Here at the source<br>
I'd lie for ever drinking and drawing in<br>
Your fountains, as heaven drinks from out their course<br>
The floods.<br><br>

          I close your ears with kisses<br>
And seal your nostrils; and round your neck you'll wear &mdash; <br>
Nay, let me work &mdash; a delicate chain of kisses.<br>
Like beads they go around, and not one misses<br>
To touch its fellow on either side.<br><br>

          And there<br>
Full mid-between the champaign of your breast<br>
I place a great and burning seal of love<br>
Like a dark rose, a mystery of rest<br>
On the slow bubbling of your rhythmic heart.<br>
Nay, I persist, and very faith shall keep<br>
You integral to me. Each door, each mystic port<br>
Of egress from you I will seal and steep<br>
In perfect chrism.<br><br>

                  Now it is done. The mort<br>
Will sound in heaven before it is undone.<br><br>

But let me finish what I have begun<br>
And shirt you now invulnerable in the mail<br>
Of iron kisses, kisses linked like steel.<br>
Put greaves upon your thighs and knees, and frail<br>
Webbing of steel on your feet. So you shall feel<br>
Ensheathed invulnerable with me, with seven<br>
Great seals upon your outgoings, and woven<br>
Chain of my mystic will wrapped perfectly<br>
Upon you, wrapped in indomitable me.</blockquote>

But your limbs can draw<br>
Life from the earth through the touch of your padded paw.<br><br>

Now, sending a little look to us behind,<br>
Who follow slowly the track of your lovely play,<br>
You carry our bodies forward away from mind<br>
Into the light and fun of your useless day.<br><br>

       *      *      *      *       *<br><br>

Thus, for your walk, we took ourselves, and went<br>
Out by the hedge and the tree to the open ground.<br>
You ran, in delightful strata of wafted scent,<br>
Over the hill without seeing the view;<br>
Beauty is smell upon primitive smell to you:<br>
To you, as to us, it is distant and rarely found.<br><br>

Home ... and further joy will be surely there:<br>
Supper waiting full of the taste of bone.<br>
You throw up your nose again, and sniff, and stare<br>
For the rapture known<br>
Of the quick wild gorge of food and the still lie-down<br>
While your people talk above you in the light<br>
Of candles, and your dreams will merge and drown<br>
Into the bed-delicious hours of night.</blockquote><br>

<br>
<blockquote>Here is the soundless cypress on the lawn:<br>
It listens, listens. Taller trees beyond<br>
Listen. The moon at the unruffled pond<br>
    Stares. And you sing, you sing.<br><br>

That star-enchanted song falls through the air<br>
From lawn to lawn down terraces of sound,<br>
Darts in white arrows on the shadowed ground;<br>
    And all the night you sing.<br><br>

My dreams are flowers to which you are a bee<br>
As all night long I listen, and my brain<br>
Receives your song, then loses it again<br>
    In moonlight on the lawn.<br><br>

Now is your voice a marble high and white,<br>
Then like a mist on fields of paradise,<br>
Now is a raging fire, then is like ice,<br>
    Then breaks, and it is dawn.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>The tough hand closes gently on the load;<br>
  Out of the mind, a voice<br>
Calls 'Lift!' and the arms, remembering well their work,<br>
  Lengthen and pause for help.<br>
Then a slow ripple flows from head to foot<br>
While all the muscles call to one another:<br>
  'Lift! 'and the bulging bale<br>
  Floats like a butterfly in June.<br><br>

So moved the earliest carrier of bales,<br>
  And the same watchful sun<br>
Glowed through his body feeding it with light.<br>
  So will the last one move,<br>
And halt, and dip his head, and lay his load<br>
Down, and the muscles will relax and tremble.<br>
  Earth, you designed your man<br>
Beautiful both in labour and repose.</blockquote>

<h3>For Bessie, Seated by Me in the Garden</h3>

<blockquote>To the heart, to the heart the white petals<br>
Quietly fall.<br>
Memory is a little wind, and magical<br>
The dreaming hours.<br>
As a breath they fall, as a sigh;<br>
Green garden hours too langorous to waken,<br>
White leaves of blossomy tree wind-shaken:<br>
As a breath, a sigh,<br>
As the slow white drift<br>
Of a butterfly.<br>
Flower-wings falling, wings of branches<br>
One after one at wind's droop dipping;<br>
Then with the lift<br>
Of the air's soft breath, in sudden avalanches<br>
Slipping.<br>
Quietly, quietly the June wind flings<br>
White wings,<br>
White petals, past the footpath flowers<br>
Adown my dreaming hours.<br>
At the heart, at the heart the butterfly settles.<br>
As a breath, a sigh<br>
Fall the petals of hours, of the white-leafed flowers,<br>
Fall the petalled wings of the butterfly.<br>
To my heart, to my heart the white petals<br>
Quietly fall.<br><br>

To the years, other years, old and wistful<br>
Drifts my dream.<br>
Petal-patined the dream, white-mistful<br>
As the dew-sweet haunt of the dim whitebeam<br>
Because of memory, a little wind ...<br>
It is the gossamer-float of the butterfly<br>
This drift of dream<br>
From the sweet of to-day to the sweet<br>
Of days long drifted by.<br>
It is the drift of the butterfly, it is the fleet<br>
Drift of petals which my noon has thinned,<br>
It is the ebbing out of my life, of the petals of days.<br>
To the years, other years, drifts my dream....<br>
Through the haze<br>
Of summers long ago<br>
Love's entrancements flow,<br>
A blue-green pageant of earth,<br>
A green-blue pageant of sky,<br>
As a stream,<br>
Flooding back with lovely delta to my heart.<br>
Lo the petalled leafage is finer, under the feet<br>
The coarse soil with a rainbow's worth<br>
Of delicate colours lies enamelled,<br>
Translucently glowing, shining.<br>
Each balmy breath of the hours<br>
From eastern gleam to westward gloam<br>
Is meaning-full as the falling flowers:<br>
It is a crystal syllable<br>
For love's defining,<br>
It is love alone can spell &mdash;  &mdash; <br>
Yea, Love remains: after this drift of days<br>
Love is here, Love is not dumb.<br>
The touch of a silken hand, comradely, untrammelled<br>
Is in the sunlight, a bright glance<br>
On every ripple of yonder waterways,<br>
A whisper in the dance<br>
Of green shadows;<br>
Nor shall the sunlight be shut out even from the dark.<br><br>

Beyond the garden heavy oaks are buoyant on the meadows,<br>
Their rugged bark<br>
No longer rough,<br>
But chastened and refined in the glowing eyes of Love.<br>
Around us the petals fulfil<br>
Their measure and fall, precious the petals are still.<br>
For Love they once were gathered, they are gathered for Love again,<br>
Whose glance is on the water,<br>
Whose whisper is in the green shadows.<br>
In the same comrade-hand whose touch is in the sunlight,<br>
They are lying again.<br>
Here Love is ... Love only of all things outstays<br>
The drift of petals, the drift of days,<br>
Petals of hours,<br>
Of white-leafed flowers,<br>
Petalled wings of the butterfly,<br>
Drifting, quietly drifting by<br>
As a breath, a sigh....</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>Brown earth, sun-soaked,<br>
Beneath his head<br>
And over the quiet limbs....<br>
Through time unreckoned<br>
Lay this brown earth for him. Now is he come.<br>
Truly he hath a sweet bed.<br><br>

From invisible gardens is chaliced by kindly airs<br>
And carried for welcome to the stranger.<br>
Long seasons ere he came, this wilderness<br>
They habited.<br><br>

They, and the mist of stars<br>
Down-spread<br>
About him as a hush of vespering birds.<br>
They, and the sun, the moon:<br>
Naught now denies him the moon's coming,<br>
Nor the morning trail of gold,<br>
The luminous print of evening, red<br>
At the sun's tread.<br><br>

The brown earth holds him.<br>
The stars and little winds, the friendly moon<br>
And sun attend in turn his rest.<br>
They linger above him, softly moving. They are gracious,<br>
And gently-wise: as though remembering how his hunger,<br>
His kinship, knew them once but blindly<br>
In thoughts unsaid,<br>
As a dream that fled.<br><br>

So is he theirs assuredly as the seasons.<br>
So is his sleep by them for ever companioned.<br>
...And, perchance, by the voices of bright children playing<br>
And knowing not: by the echo of young laughter<br>
When their dancing is sped.<br>
Truly he hath a sweet bed.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="spriglime">Robert Nichols</a></h2>
<br>
<h3>The Sprig of Lime</h3><br>

<blockquote>He lay, and those who watched him were amazed<br>
To see unheralded beneath the lids<br>
Twin tears, new-gathered at the price of pain,<br>
Start and at once run crookedly athwart<br>
Cheeks channelled long by pain, never by tears.<br>
So desolate too the sigh next uttered<br>
They had wept also, but his great lips moved,<br>
And bending down one heard, '<i>A sprig of lime;<br>
Bring me a sprig of lime.</i>' Whereat she stole<br>
With dumb signs forth to pluck the thing he craved.<br><br>

So lay he till a lime-twig had been snapped<br>
From some still branch that swept the outer grass<br>
Far from the silver pillar of the bole<br>
Which mounting past the house's crusted roof<br>
Split into massy limbs, crossed boughs, a maze<br>
Of close-compacted intercontorted staffs<br>
Bowered in foliage wherethrough the sun<br>
Shot sudden showers of light or crystal spars<br>
Or wavered in a green and vitreous flood.<br>
And all the while in faint and fainter tones<br>
Scarce audible on deepened evening's hush<br>
He framed his curious and last request<br>
For '<i>lime, a sprig of lime.</i>' Her trembling hand<br>
Closed his loose fingers on the awkward stem<br>
Covered above with gentle heart-shaped leaves<br>
And under dangling, pale as honey-wax,<br>
Square clusters of sweet-scented starry flowers.<br><br>

She laid his bent arm back upon his breast,<br>
Then watched above white knuckles clenched in prayer.<br><br>

He never moved. Only at last his eyes<br>
Opened, then brightened in such avid gaze<br>
She feared the coma mastered him again ...<br>
But no; strange sobs rose chuckling in his throat,<br>
A stranger ecstasy suffused the flesh<br>
Of that just mask so sun-dried, gouged and old<br>
Which few &mdash; too few! &mdash; had loved, too many feared.<br>
'Father!' she cried; 'Father!'<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                     He did not hear.<br><br>

She knelt and kneeling drank the scent of limes,<br>
Blown round the slow blind by a vesperal gust,<br>
Till the room swam. So the lime-incense blew<br>
Into her life as once it had in his,<br>
Though how and when and with what ageless charge<br>
Of sorrow and deep joy how could she know?<br><br>

Sweet lime that often at the height of noon<br>
Diffusing dizzy fragrance from your boughs,<br>
Tasselled with blossoms more innumerable<br>
Than the black bees, the uproar of whose toil<br>
Filled your green vaults, winning such metheglyn<br>
As clouds their sappy cells, distil, as once<br>
Ye used, your sunniest emanations<br>
Toward the window where a woman kneels &mdash; <br>
She who within that room in childish hours<br>
Lay through the lasting murmur of blanch'd noon<br>
Behind the sultry blind, now full now flat,<br>
Drinking anew of every odorous breath,<br>
Supremely happy in her ignorance<br>
Of Time that hastens hourly and of Death<br>
Who need not haste. Scatter your fumes, O lime,<br>
Loose from each hispid star of citron bloom,<br>
Tangled beneath the labyrinthine boughs,<br>
Cloud on such stinging cloud of exhalations<br>
As reek of youth, fierce life and summer's prime,<br>
Though hardly now shall he in that dusk room<br>
Savour your sweetness, since the very sprig,<br>
Profuse of blossom and of essences,<br>
He smells not, who in a paltering hand<br>
Clasps it laid close his peaked and gleaming face<br>
Propped in the pillow. Breathe silent, lofty lime,<br>
Your curfew secrets out in fervid scent<br>
To the attendant shadows! Tinge the air<br>
Of the midsummer night that now begins,<br>
At an owl's oaring flight from dusk to dusk<br>
And downward caper of the giddy bat<br>
Hawking against the lustre of bare skies,<br>
With something of th' unfathomable bliss<br>
He, who lies dying there, knew once of old<br>
In the serene trance of a summer night<br>
When with th' abundance of his young bride's hair<br>
Loosed on his breast he lay and dared not sleep,<br>
Listening for the scarce motion of your boughs,<br>
Which sighed with bliss as she with blissful sleep,<br>
And drinking desperately each honied wave<br>
Of perfume wafted past the ghostly blind<br>
Knew first th' implacable and bitter sense<br>
Of Time that hastes and Death who need not haste.<br>
Shed your last sweetness, limes!<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                      But now no more.<br>
She, fruit of that night's love, she heeds you not,<br>
Who bent, compassionate, to the dim floor<br>
Takes up the sprig of lime and presses it<br>
In pain against the stumbling of her heart,<br>
Knowing, untold, he cannot need it now.</blockquote>

<br>
<i>For Anne</i>.<br>
<br>

<blockquote>All the loud winds were in the garden wood,<br>
All shadows joyfuller than lissom hounds<br>
Doubled in chasing, all exultant clouds<br>
That ever flung fierce mist and eddying fire<br>
Across heavens deeper than blue polar seas<br>
Fled over the sceptre-spikes of the chestnuts,<br>
Over the speckle of the wych-elms' green.<br>
She shouted; then stood still, hushed and abashed<br>
To hear her voice so shrill in that gay roar,<br>
And suddenly her eyelashes were dimmed,<br>
Caught in tense tears of spiritual joy;<br>
For there were daffodils which sprightly shook<br>
Ten thousand ruffling heads throughout the wood,<br>
And every flower of those delighting flowers<br>
Laughed, nodding to her, till she clapped her hands<br>
Crying 'O daffies, could you only speak!'<br><br>

But there was more. A jay with skyblue shaft<br>
Set in blunt wing, skimmed screaming on ahead.<br>
She followed him. A murrey squirrel eyed<br>
Her warily, cocked upon tail-plumed haunch,<br>
Then, skipping the whirligig of last-year leaves,<br>
Whisked himself out of sight and reappeared<br>
Leering about the hole of a young beech;<br>
And every time she thought to corner him<br>
He scrambled round on little scratchy hands<br>
To peek at her about the other side.<br>
She lost him, bolting branch to branch, at last &mdash; <br>
The impudent brat! But still high overhead<br>
Flight on exuberant flight of opal scud,<br>
Or of dissolving mist, florid as flame.<br><br>

Scattered in ecstasy over the blue. And she<br>
Followed, first walking, giving her bright locks<br>
To the cold fervour of the springtime gale,<br>
Whose rush bore the cloud shadow past the cloud<br>
Over the irised wastes of emerald turf.<br>
And still the huge wind volleyed. Save the gulls,<br>
Goldenly in the sunny blast careering<br>
Or on blue-shadowed underwing at plunge,<br>
None shared with her who now could not but run<br>
The splendour and tumult of th' onrushing spring.<br><br>

And now she ran no more: the gale gave plumes.<br>
One with the shadows whirled along the grass,<br>
One with the onward smother of veering gulls,<br>
One with the pursuit of cloud after cloud,<br>
Swept she. Pure speed coursed in immortal limbs;<br>
Nostrils drank as from wells of unknown air;<br>
Ears received the smooth silence of racing floods;<br>
Light as of glassy suns froze in her eyes;<br>
Space was given her and she ruled all space.<br><br>

Spring, author of twifold loveliness,<br>
Who flittest in the mirth of the wild folk,<br>
Profferest greeting in the faces of flowers,<br>
Blowest in the firmamental glory,<br>
Renewest in the heart of the sad human<br>
All faiths, guard thou the innocent spirit<br>
Into whose unknowing hands this noontide<br>
Thou pourest treasure, yet scarce recognised,<br>
That unashamed before man's glib wisdom,<br>
Unabashed beneath the wrath of chance,<br>
She accept in simplicity of homage<br>
The hidden holiness, the created emblem<br>
To be in her, until death shall take her,<br>
The source and secret of eternal spring.</blockquote>

Hark! Thud, thud, thud, &mdash; quite soft ... they never cease &mdash; <br>
Those whispering guns &mdash; O Christ, I want to go out<br>
And screech at them to stop &mdash; I'm going crazy;<br>
I'm going stark, staring mad because of the guns.</blockquote>

<br>
(<i>Egyptian Base Camp</i>).<br>
<br>
<blockquote>They are gathering round ...<br>
Out of the twilight; over the grey-blue sand,<br>
Shoals of low-jargoning men drift inward to the sound &mdash; <br>
The jangle and throb of a piano ... tum-ti-tum ...<br>
Drawn by a lamp, they come<br>
Out of the glimmering lines of their tents, over the shuffling sand.<br><br>

O sing us the songs, the songs of our own land,<br>
You warbling ladies in white.<br>
Dimness conceals the hunger in our faces,<br>
This wall of faces risen out of the night,<br>
These eyes that keep their memories of the places<br>
So long beyond their sight.<br><br>

Jaded and gay, the ladies sing; and the chap in brown<br>
Tilts his grey hat; jaunty and lean and pale,<br>
He rattles the keys ... Some actor-bloke from town ...<br>
<i>God send you home</i>; and then <i>A long, long trail;<br>
I hear you calling me</i>; and <i>Dixieland</i>....<br>
Sing slowly ... now the chorus ... one by one<br>
We hear them, drink them; till the concert's done.<br>
Silent, I watch the shadowy mass of soldiers stand.<br>
Silent, they drift away, over the glimmering sand.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote>In fifty years, when peace outshines<br>
Remembrance of the battle lines,<br>
Adventurous lads will sigh and cast<br>
Proud looks upon the plundered past.<br>
On summer morn or winter's night,<br>
Their hearts will kindle for the fight,<br>
Reading a snatch of soldier-song,<br>
Savage and jaunty, fierce and strong;<br>
And through the angry marching rhymes<br>
Of blind regret and haggard mirth,<br>
They'll envy us the dazzling times<br>
When sacrifice absolved our earth.<br><br>

Some ancient man with silver locks<br>
Will lift his weary face to say:<br>
'War was a fiend who stopped our clocks<br>
Although we met him grim and gay.'<br>
And then he'll speak of Haig's last drive,<br>
Marvelling that any came alive<br>
Out of the shambles that men built<br>
And smashed, to cleanse the world of guilt.<br>
But the boys, with grin and sidelong glance,<br>
Will think, 'Poor grandad's day is done.'<br>
And dream of those who fought in France<br>
And lived in time to share the fun.</blockquote>

And wonder how you'd match your dreams with mine,<br>
If, mastering time's illusion, I could call<br>
You back to share this quiet candle-shine.<br><br>

For you were young, three hundred years ago;<br>
And by your looks I guess that you were wise ...<br>
Come, whisper soft, and Death will never know<br>
You've slipped away from those calm, painted eyes.<br><br>

Strange is your voice ... Poor ninny, dead so long,<br>
And all your pride forgotten like your name.<br>

And joy was in my heart like leaves aflame.'</i><br><br>

And so you died before your songs took wing;<br>
While Andrew Marvell followed in your wake.<br>
<i>'Love thrilled me into music. I could sing<br>
But for a moment, &mdash; but for beauty's sake.'</i><br><br>

Who passes? There's a star-lit breeze that stirs<br>
The glimmer of white lilies in the gloom.<br>
Who speaks? Death has his silent messengers.<br>
And there was more than silence in this room<br><br>

While you were gazing at me from the wall<br>
And wondering how you'd match your dreams with mine,<br>
If, mastering time's illusion, you could call<br>
Me back to share your vanished candle-shine.</blockquote>

Drain silently out of the cloudy blue;<br>
The trees are full of the dark-stooping night,<br>

All's quiet in the wood but, far away,<br>
Down the hillside and out across the plain,<br>
Moves, with long trail of white that marks its way,<br>
  The softly panting train.<br><br>

Come through the clearing. Hardly now we see<br>
The flowers, save dark or light against the grass,<br>
Or glimmering silver on a scented tree<br>
  That trembles as we pass.<br><br>

Hark now! So far, so far ... that distant song ...<br>
Move not the rustling grasses with your feet.<br>
The dusk is full of sounds, that all along<br>
  The muttering boughs repeat.<br><br>

So far, so faint, we lift our heads in doubt.<br>
Wind, or the blood that beats within our ears,<br>
Has feigned a dubious and delusive note,<br>
  Such as a dreamer hears.<br><br>

Again ... again! The faint sounds rise and fail.<br>
So far the enchanted tree, the song so low...<br>
A drowsy thrush? A waking nightingale?<br>

And whispered, though the soft word choked my throat,<br>
Your dear name out across the valley deep.<br>
Be near to me, for now I need you most.<br>
To-night I saw an unsubstantial flame<br>

Shining steadily with a green light, the glow-worm lies.<br><br>

We regard it; and this hill and all the other hills<br>
That fall in folds to the river, very smooth and steep,<br>
And the hangers and brakes that the darkness thickly fills<br>
Fade like phantoms round the light, and night is deep, so deep, &mdash; <br><br>

That all the world is emptiness about the still flame,<br>
And we are small shadows standing lost in the huge night.<br>
We gather up the glow-worm, stooping with dazzled sight,<br>
And carry it to the little enclosed garden whence we came,<br><br>

And place it on the short grass. Then the shadowy flowers fade,<br>
The walls waver and melt and the houses disappear<br>
And the solid town trembles into insubstantial shade<br>
Round the light of the burning glow-worm, steady and clear.</blockquote>

With unaccustomed mouths bellow and cry<br>
And vex the waves with struggling fin and fold.<br><br>

And with these too come little trivial things<br>
Tossed from the deeps by the same casual hand;<br>
A faint sea flower, dragged from the lowest sand,<br>
That will not undulate its luminous wings<br>
In the slow tides again, lies dead and swings<br>
Along the muddy ripples to the land.</blockquote>

<a name="festgal"></a><h3>Fête Galante; the Triumph of Love</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Aristonoë, the fading shepherdess,<br>
Gathers the young girls round her in a ring,<br>
Teaching them wisdom of love,<br>
What to say, how to dress,<br>
How frown, how smile,<br>
How suitors to their dancing feet to bring,<br>
How in mere walking to beguile,<br>
What words cunningly said in what a way<br>
Will draw man's busy fancy astray,<br>
All the alphabet, grammar and syntax of love.<br><br>

The garden smells are sweet,<br>
Daisies spring in the turf under the high-heeled feet,<br>
Dense, dark banks of laurel grow<br>
Behind the wavering row<br>
Of golden, flaxen, black, brown, auburn heads,<br>
Behind the light and shimmering dresses<br>
Of these unreal, modern shepherdesses;<br>
And gaudy flowers in formal patterned beds<br>
Vary the dim long vistas of the park,<br>
Far as the eye can see,<br>
Till at the forest's edge the ground grows dark<br>
And the flowers vanish in the obscurity.<br><br>

The young girls gather round her,<br>
Remembering eagerly how their fathers found her<br>
Fresh as a spring-like wind in February,<br>
Subtler in her moving heart than sun-motes that vary<br>
At every waft of an opening and shutting door;<br>
They gather chattering near,<br>
Hush, break out in laughter, whisper aside,<br>
Grow silent more and more,        <br>
Though she will never chide.<br>
Now through the silence sounds her voice still clear,<br>
And all give ear.<br>
Like a silver thread through the golden afternoon,<br>
Equably the voice discloses<br>
All that age-old wisdom; like an endless tune<br>
Aristonoë's voice wavers among the roses,<br>
Level and unimpassioned,<br>
Telling them how of nothing love is fashioned,<br>
How it is but a movement of the mind,<br>
Bidding Celia mark<br>
That light skirts fluttering in the wind,<br>
Or white flowers stuck in dark<br>
Glistening hair, have fired the dull beholder,<br>
Or telling Anais<br>
That faint indifference ere now hath bred a kiss<br>
Denied to flaunted snowy breast or shoulder.<br><br>

The girls attend,<br>
Each thinking on her friend,<br>
Whether he be real or imaginary,<br>
Whether he be loving or cold;<br>
For each ere she grows old<br>
Means to pursue her joy, and the whole unwary<br>
Troop of their wishes has this wild quarry in cry,<br>
That draws them ineluctably,<br>
More and more as the summer slippeth by.<br>
And Celia leans aside<br>
To contemplate her black-silked ankle on the grass;<br>
In remote dreaming pride,<br>
Rosalind recalls the image in her glass;<br>
Phillis through all her body feels<br>
How divine energy steals,<br>
Quiescent power and resting speed,<br>
Stretches her arms out, feels the warm blood run<br>
Ready for pursuit, for strife and deed,<br>
And turns her glowing face up to the sun.<br>
Phillida smiles,<br>
And lazily trusts her lazy wit,<br>
A slow arrow that hath often hit;<br>
Chloe, bemused by many subtle wiles,<br>
Grows not more dangerous for all of it,<br>
But opens her red lips, yawning drowsily,<br>
And shows her small white teeth,<br>
Dimpling the round chin beneath,<br>
And stretches, moving her young body deliciously.<br><br>

And still the lesson goes on,<br>
For this is an old story that is never done;<br>
And now the precept is of ribbon and shoe,<br>
What with linens and silks love finds to do,<br>
And how man's heart is tangled in a string<br>
Or taken in gauze like a weak and helpless thing.<br>
Chloe falls asleep; and the long summer day<br>
Drifts slowly past the girls and the warm roses,<br>
Giving in dreams its hours away.<br>
Now Stella throws her head back, and Phillis disposes<br>
Her strong brown hands quietly in her lap,<br>
And Rose's slender feet grow restless and tap<br>
The turf to an imaginary tune.<br>
Now all this grace of youthful bodies and faces<br>
Is wrought to a glow by the golden weather of June;<br>
Now, Love, completing grace of all the graces,<br>
Strong in these hearts thy pure streams rise,<br>
Transmuting what they learn by heavenly alchemies.<br>
Swift from the listeners the spell vanishes,<br>
And through the tinkling, empty words,    <br>
True thoughts of true love press,         <br>
Flying and wheeling nearer;<br>
As through a sunny sky a flock of birds<br>
Against the throbbing blue grows clearer and clearer,<br>
So closer come these thoughts and dearer.<br><br>

Helen rises with a laugh;<br>
Chloe wakes;<br>
All the enchantment scatters off like chaff;<br>
The cord is loosened and the spell breaks.<br>
Rosalind<br>
Resolves that to-night she will be kind to her lover,<br>
Unreflecting, warm and kind.<br>
Celia tells the lessons over,<br>
Counting on her fingers &mdash; one and two ...<br>
Ribbon and shoe,<br>
Skirts, flowers, song, dancing, laughter, eyes ...<br>
Through the whole catalogue of formal gallantry<br>
And studious coquetries,<br>
Counting to herself maliciously.<br><br>

But the old, the fading shepherdess, Aristonoë,<br>
Rises stiffly and walks alone<br>
Down the broad path where densely the laurels grow,<br>
And over a little lawn, not closely mown,<br>
Where wave the flowering grass and the rich meadowsweet.<br>
She seems to walk painfully now and slow,  <br>
And drags a little on her high-heeled feet.<br>
She stops at last below<br>
An old and twisted plum-tree, whose last petal is gone,<br>
Leans on the comfortable, rugged bole,<br>
And stares through the green leaves at the drooping sun.<br>
The tree and the warm light comfort her ageing soul.<br><br>

On the other lawn behind her, out of sight,<br>
The girls at play<br>
Drive out melancholy by lively delight,<br>
And the wind carries their songs and laughter away.<br>
Some begin dancing and seriously tread<br>
A modern measure up and down the grass,<br>
Turn, slide with bending knees, and pass<br>
With dipping hand and poising head,<br>
Float through the sun in pairs, like newly shed<br>
And golden leaves astray<br>
Upon the warm wind of an autumn day,<br>
When the Indian summer rules the air.<br>
Others, having found,<br>
Lying idly on the sun-hot ground,<br>
Shuttlecocks and battledores,<br>
Play with the buoyant feathers and stare<br>
Dazzled at the plaything as it soars,<br>
Vague against the shining sky,<br>
Where light yet throbs and confuses the eye,<br>
Then see it again, white and clear,<br>
As slowly, poisèdly it falls by<br>
The dark green foliage and floats near.<br>
But Celia, apart, is pensive and must sigh,<br>
And Anais but faintly pursues the game.<br>
An encroaching, inner flame<br>
Burns in their hearts with the acrid smoke of unrest;<br>
But gaiety runs like quicksilver in Rose's breast,<br>
And Phillis, rising,<br>
Walks by herself with high and springy tread,<br>
All her young blood racing from heels to head,<br>
Breeding new desires and a new surprising<br>
Strength and determination,<br>
Whereof are bred<br>
Confidence and joy and exultation.<br><br>

The long day closes;             <br>
Rosalind's hour draws near, and Chloe's and Rose's,<br>
The hour that Celia has prayed,<br>
The hour for which Anais and Stella have stayed,<br>
When Helen shall forget her wit,<br>
And Phillida by a sure arrow at length be hit,<br>
And Phillis, the fleet runner, be at length overtaken;<br>
When this bough of young blossoms<br>
By the rough, eager gatherers shall be shaken.<br>
Their eyes grow dim,<br>
Their hearts flutter like taken birds in their bosoms,<br>
As the light dies out of heaven,<br>
And a faint, delicious tremor runs through every limb,<br>
And faster the volatile blood through their veins is driven.<br><br>

The long day closes;<br>
The last light fades in the amber sky;<br>
Warm through the warm dusk glow the roses,<br>
And a heavier shade drops slowly from the trees,<br>
While through the garden as all colours die<br>
The scents come livelier on the quickening breeze.<br>
The world grows larger, vaguer, dimmer,<br>
Over the dark laurels a few faint stars glimmer;<br>
The moon, that was a pallid ghost,<br>
Hung low on the horizon, faint and lost,<br>
Comes up, a full and splendid golden round<br>
By black and sharp-cut foliage overcrossed.<br>
The girls laugh and whisper now with hardly a sound<br>
Till all sound vanishes, dispersed in the night,<br>
Like a wisp of cloud that fades in the moon's light,<br>
And the garden grows silent and the shadows grow<br>
Deeper and blacker below<br>
The mysteriously moving and murmuring trees,<br>
That stand out darkly against the star-luminous sky;<br>
Huge stand the trees,<br>
Shadowy, whispering immensities,<br>
That rain down quietude and darkness on heart and eye.<br>
None move, none speak, none sigh<br>
But from the laurels comes a leaping voice<br>
Crying in tones that seem not man's nor boy's,<br>
But only joy's,<br>
And hard behind a loud tumultuous crying,<br>
A tangled skein of noise,<br>
And the girls see their lovers come, each vying<br>
Against the next in glad and confident poise,<br>
Or softly moving<br>
To the side of the chosen with gentle words and loving<br>
Gifts for her pleasure of sweetmeats and jewelled toys.<br><br>

Dear Love, whose strength no pedantry can stir,<br>
Whether in thine iron enemies,<br>
Or in thine own strayed follower<br>
Bemused with subtleties and sophistries,<br>
Now dost thou rule the garden, now<br>
The gatherers' hands have grasped the scented bough.<br><br>

Slow the sweet hours resolve, and one by one are sped.<br>
The garden lieth empty. Overhead<br>
A nightjar rustles by, wing touching wing,<br>
And passes, uttering<br>
His hoarse and whirring note.<br>
The daylight birds long since are fled,<br>
Nor has the moon yet touched the brown bird's throat.<br><br>

All's quiet, all is silent, all around     <br>
The day's heat rises gently from the ground, <br>
And still the broad moon travels up the sky,<br>
Now glancing through the trees and now so high<br>
That all the garden through her rays are shed,<br>
And from the laurels one can just descry<br>
Where in the distance looms enormously<br>
The old house, with all its windows black and dead.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>Now when I sleep the thrush breaks through my dreams<br>
With sharp reminders of the coming day:<br>
After his call, one minute I remain<br>
Unwaked, and on the darkness which is Me<br>
There springs the image of a daffodil,<br>
Growing upon a grassy bank alone,<br>
And seeming with great joy his bell to fill<br>
With drops of golden dew, which on the lawn<br>
He shakes again, where they lie bright and chill.<br><br>

His head is drooped; the shrouded winds that sing<br>
Bend him which way they will: never on earth<br>
Was there before so beautiful a ghost.<br>
Alas! he had a less than flower-birth,<br>
And like a ghost indeed must shortly glide<br>
From all but the sad cells of memory,<br>
Where he will linger, an imprisoned beam,<br>
Or fallen shadow of the golden world,<br>
Long after this and many another dream.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I wish this world and its green hills were mine,<br>
But it is not; the wandering shepherd star<br>
Is not more distant, gazing from afar<br>
On the unreapèd pastures of the sea,<br>
Than I am from the world, the world from me.<br>
At night the stars on milky way that shine<br>
Seem things one might possess, but this round green<br>
Is for the cows that rest, these and the sheep:<br>
To them the slopes and pastures offer sleep;<br>
My sleep I draw from the far fields of blue,<br>
Whence cold winds come and go among the few<br>
Bright stars we see and many more unseen.<br><br>

Birds sing on earth all day among the flowers,<br>
Taking no thought of any other thing<br>
But their own hearts, for out of them they sing:<br>
Their songs are kindred to the blossom heads,<br>
Faint as the petals which the blackthorn sheds,<br>
And like the earth &mdash; not alien songs as ours.<br>
To them this greenness and this island peace<br>
Are life and death and happiness in one;<br>
Nor are they separate from the white sun,<br>
Or those warm winds which nightly wash the deep<br>
Or starlight in the valleys, or new sleep;<br>
And from these things they ask for no release.<br><br>

But we can never call this world our own,<br>
Because we long for it, and yet we know<br>
That should the great winds call us, we should go;<br>
Should they come calling out across the cold,<br>
We should rise up and leave the sheltered fold<br>
And follow the great road to the unknown,<br>
We should pass by the barns and haystacks brown, <br>
Should leave the wild pool and the nightingale; <br>
Across the ocean we should set a sail<br>
And, coming to the world's pale brim, should fly<br>
Out to the very middle of the sky,<br>
On past the moon; nor should we once look down.</blockquote>

<a name="newgh"></a><h3>The New Ghost</h3>
<br>
<i>'And he, casting away his garment, rose and came to Jesus.'</i><br>
<br>
<blockquote>And he cast it down, down, on the green grass,<br>
Over the young crocuses, where the dew was &mdash; <br>
He cast the garment of his flesh that was full of death,<br>
And like a sword his spirit showed out of the cold sheath.<br><br>

He went a pace or two, he went to meet his Lord,<br>
And, as I said, his spirit looked like a clean sword,<br>
And seeing him the naked trees began shivering,<br>
And all the birds cried out aloud as it were late spring.<br><br>

And the Lord came on, He came down, and saw<br>
That a soul was waiting there for Him, one without flaw,<br>
And they embraced in the churchyard where the robins play,<br>
And the daffodils hang down their heads, as they burn away.<br><br>

The Lord held his head fast, and you could see<br>
That he kissed the unsheathed ghost that was gone free &mdash; <br>
As a hot sun, on a March day, kisses the cold ground;<br>
And the spirit answered, for he knew well that his peace was found.<br><br>

The spirit trembled, and sprang up at the Lord's word &mdash; <br>
As on a wild, April day, springs a small bird &mdash; <br>
So the ghost's feet lifting him up, he kissed the Lord's cheek,<br>
And for the greatness of their love neither of them could speak.<br><br>

But the Lord went then, to show him the way,<br>
Over the young crocuses, under the green may<br>
That was not quite in flower yet &mdash; to a far-distant land;<br>
And the ghost followed, like a naked cloud holding the sun's hand.</blockquote>

<h3>Rivers</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Rivers I have seen which were beautiful,<br>
Slow rivers winding in the flat fens,<br>
With bands of reeds like thronged green swords<br>
  Guarding the mirrored sky;<br>
And streams down-tumbling from the chalk hills<br>
To valleys of meadows and watercress-beds,<br>
And bridges whereunder, dark weed-coloured shadows,<br>
  Trout flit or lie,<br><br>

I know those rivers that peacefully glide<br>
Past old towers and shaven gardens,<br>
Where mottled walls rise from the water<br>
  And mills all streaked with flour;<br>
And rivers with wharves and rusty shipping,<br>
That flow with a stately tidal motion<br>
Towards their destined estuaries<br>
  Full of the pride of power;<br><br>

Noble great rivers, Thames and Severn,<br>
Tweed with his gateway of many grey arches,<br>
Clyde, dying at sunset westward<br>
  In a sea as red as blood;<br>
Rhine and his hills in close procession,<br>
Placid Elbe, Seine slaty and swirling,<br>
And Isar, son of the Alpine snows,<br>
  A furious turquoise flood.<br><br>

All these I have known, and with slow eyes<br>
I have walked on their shores and watched them,<br>
And softened to their beauty and loved them<br>
  Wherever my feet have been;<br><br>

And a hundred others also<br>
Whose names long since grew into me,<br>
That, dreaming in light or darkness,<br>
  I have seen, though I have not seen.<br><br>

Those rivers of thought: cold Ebro,<br>
And blue racing Guadiana,<br>
Passing white houses, high-balconied<br>
  That ache in a sun-baked land,<br>
Congo, and Nile and Colorado,<br>
Niger, Indus, Zambesi,<br>
And the Yellow River, and the Oxus,<br>
  And the river that dies in sand.<br><br>

What splendours are theirs, what continents,<br>
What tribes of men, what basking plains,<br>
Forests and lion-hided deserts,<br>
  Marshes, ravines and falls:<br>
All hues and shapes and tempers<br>
Wandering they take as they wander<br>
From those far springs that endlessly<br>
  The far sea calls.<br><br>

O in reverie I know the Volga<br>
That turns his back upon Europe,<br>
And the two great cities on his banks,<br>
  Novgorod and Astrakhan;<br>
Where the world is a few soft colours,<br>
And under the dove-like evening<br>
The boatmen chant ancient songs,<br>
  The tenderest known to man.<br><br>

And the holy river Ganges,<br>
His fretted cities veiled in moonlight,<br>
Arches and buttresses silver-shadowy    <br>
  In the high moon,             <br><br>

And palms grouped in the moonlight<br>
And fanes girdled with cypresses,<br>
Their domes of marble softly shining<br>
  To the high silver moon.<br>
And that aged Brahmapootra<br>
Who beyond the white Himalayas<br>
Passes many a lamassery<br>
  On rocks forlorn and frore,<br>
A block of gaunt grey stone walls<br>
With rows of little barred windows,<br>
Where shrivelled young monks in yellow silk<br>
  Are hidden for evermore....<br><br>

But O that great river, the Amazon,<br>
I have sailed up its gulf with eyelids closed,<br>
And the yellow waters tumbled round,<br>
  And all was rimmed with sky,<br>
Till the banks drew in, and the trees' heads,<br>
And the lines of green grew higher<br>
And I breathed deep, and there above me<br>
  The forest wall stood high.<br><br>

Those forest walls of the Amazon<br>
Are level under the blazing blue<br>
And yield no sound but the whistles and shrieks<br>
  Of the swarming bright macaws;<br>
And under their lowest drooping boughs<br>
Mud-banks torpidly bubble,<br>
And the water drifts, and logs in the water<br>
  Drift and twist and pause.<br><br>

And everywhere, tacitly joining,<br>
Float noiseless tributaries,<br>
Tall avenues paved with water:<br>
  And as I silent fly<br>
The vegetation like a painted scene,<br>
Spars and spikes and monstrous fans<br>
And ferns from hairy sheaths up-springing,<br>
  Evenly passes by.<br><br>

And stealthier stagnant channels<br>
Under low niches of drooping leaves<br>
Coil into deep recesses:<br>
  And there have I entered, there<br>
To heavy, hot, dense, dim places<br>
Where creepers climb and sweat and climb,<br>
And the drip and splash of oozing water<br>
  Loads the stifling air.<br><br>

Rotting scrofulous steaming trunks,<br>
Great horned emerald beetles crawling,<br>
Ants and huge slow butterflies<br>
  That had strayed and lost the sun;<br>
Ah, sick I have swooned as the air thickened<br>
To a pallid brown ecliptic glow,<br>
And on the forest, fallen with languor,<br>
  Thunder has begun.<br><br>

Thunder in the dun dusk, thunder<br>
Rolling and battering and cracking,<br>
The caverns shudder with a terrible glare<br>
  Again and again and again,<br>
Till the land bows in the darkness,<br>
Utterly lost and defenceless,<br>
Smitten and blinded and overwhelmed<br>
  By the crashing rods of rain.<br><br>

And then in the forests of the Amazon,<br>
When the rain has ended, and silence come,<br>
What dark luxuriance unfolds<br>
  From behind the night's drawn bars:<br>
The wreathing odours of a thousand trees<br>
And the flowers' faint gleaming presences,<br>
And over the clearings and the still waters<br>
  Soft indigo and hanging stars.<br><br>

       *       *       *       *       *<br><br>

O many and many are rivers,<br>
And beautiful are all rivers,<br>
And lovely is water everywhere<br>
  That leaps or glides or stays;<br>
Yet by starlight, moonlight, or sunlight,<br>
Long, long though they look, these wandering eyes,<br>
Even on the fairest waters of dream,<br>
  Never untroubled gaze.<br><br>

For whatever stream I stand by,<br>
And whatever river I dream of,<br>
There is something still in the back of my mind<br>
  From very far away;<br>
There is something I saw and see not,<br>
A country full of rivers<br>
That stirs in my heart and speaks to me<br>
  More sure, more dear than they.<br><br>

And always I ask and wonder<br>
(Though often I do not know it):<br>
Why does this water not smell like water?<br>
  Where is the moss that grew<br>
Wet and dry on the slabs of granite<br>
And the round stones in clear brown water?<br>
 &mdash; And a pale film rises before them<br>
  Of the rivers that first I knew.<br><br>

Though famous are the rivers of the great world,<br>
Though my heart from those alien waters drinks<br>
Delight however pure from their loveliness,<br>
  And awe however deep,<br>
Would I wish for a moment the miracle,<br>
That those waters should come to Chagford,<br>
Or gather and swell in Tavy Cleave<br>
  Where the stones cling to the steep?<br><br>

No, even were they Ganges and Amazon<br>
In all their great might and majesty,<br>
League upon league of wonders,<br>
  I would lose them all, and more,<br>
For a light chiming of small bells,<br>
A twisting flash in the granite,<br>
The tiny thread of a pixie waterfall<br>
  That lives by Vixen Tor.<br><br>

Those rivers in that lost country,<br>
They were brown as a clear brown bead is<br>
Or red with the earth that rain washed down,<br>
  Or white with china-clay;<br>
And some tossed foaming over boulders,<br>
And some curved mild and tranquil,<br>
In wooded vales securely set<br>
  Under the fond warm day.<br><br>

Okement and Erme and Avon,<br>
Exe and his ruffled shallows,<br>
I could cry as I think of those rivers<br>
  That knew my morning dreams;<br>
The weir by Tavistock at evening<br>
When the circling woods were purple,<br>
And the Lowman in spring with the lent-lilies,<br>
  And the little moorland streams.<br><br>

For many a hillside streamlet         <br>
There falls with a broken tinkle,         <br>
Falling and dying, falling and dying,<br>
  In little cascades and pools,<br>
Where the world is furze and heather<br>
And flashing plovers and fixed larks,<br>
And an empty sky, whitish blue,<br>
  That small world rules.<br><br>

There, there, where the high waste bog-lands<br>
And the drooping slopes and the spreading valleys,<br>
The orchards and the cattle-sprinkled pastures<br>
  Those travelling musics fill,<br>
There is my lost Abana,<br>
And there is my nameless Pharphar<br>
That mixed with my heart when I was a boy,<br>
  And time stood still.<br><br>

And I say I will go there and die there:<br>
But I do not go there, and sometimes<br>
I think that the train could not carry me there,<br>
  And it's possible, maybe,<br>
That it's farther than Asia or Africa,<br>
Or any voyager's harbour,<br>
Farther, farther, beyond recall....<br>
  O even in memory!</blockquote>

Gathering shells. He heard a sudden strange<br>

With bellying cloths on poles, and not one oar,<br>
  And fluttering coloured signs and clambering crews.<br><br>

And he, in fear, this naked man alone,<br>
  His fallen hands forgetting all their shells,<br>
His lips gone pale, knelt low behind a stone,<br>
  And stared, and saw, and did not understand,<br>
  Columbus's doom-burdened caravels<br>
    Slant to the shore, and all their seamen land.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>Within mankind's duration, so they say,<br>
Khephren and Ninus lived but yesterday.<br>
Asia had no name till man was old<br>
And long had learned the use of iron and gold;<br>
And æons had passed, when the first corn was planted,<br>
Since first the use of syllables was granted.<br><br>

Men were on earth while climates slowly swung,<br>
Fanning wide zones to heat and cold, and long<br>
Subsidence turned great continents to sea,<br>
And seas dried up, dried up interminably,<br>
Age after age; enormous seas were dried<br>
Amid wastes of land. And the last monsters died.<br><br>

Earth wore another face. O since that prime<br>
Man with how many works has sprinkled time!<br>
Hammering, hewing, digging tunnels, roads;<br>
Building ships, temples, multiform abodes.<br>
How, for his body's appetites, his toils<br>
Have conquered all earth's products, all her soils;<br>
And in what thousand thousand shapes of art<br>
He has tried to find a language for his heart!<br><br>

Never at rest, never content or tired:<br>
Insatiate wanderer, marvellously fired,<br>
Most grandly piling and piling into the air<br>
Stones that will topple or arch he knows not where.<br><br>

And yet did I, this spring, think it more strange,<br>
More grand, more full of awe, than all that change,<br>
And lovely and sweet and touching unto tears,<br>
That through man's chronicled and unchronicled years,<br>
And even into that unguessable beyond       <br>
The water-hen has nested by a pond,       <br>
Weaving dry flags, into a beaten floor,<br>
The one sure product of her only lore.<br>
Low on a ledge above the shadowed water<br>
Then, when she heard no men, as nature taught her,<br>
Plashing around with busy scarlet bill<br>
She built that nest, her nest, and builds it still.<br><br>

O let your strong imagination turn<br>
The great wheel backward, until Troy unburn,<br>
And then unbuild, and seven Troys below<br>
Rise out of death, and dwindle, and outflow,<br>
Till all have passed, and none has yet been there:<br>
Back, ever back. Our birds still crossed the air;<br>
Beyond our myriad changing generations<br>
Still built, unchanged, their known inhabitations.<br>
A million years before Atlantis was<br>
Our lark sprang from some hollow in the grass,<br>
Some old soft hoof-print in a tussock's shade;<br>
And the wood-pigeon's smooth snow-white eggs were laid,<br>
High, amid green pines' sunset-coloured shafts,<br>
And rooks their villages of twiggy rafts<br>
Set on the tops of elms, where elms grew then,<br>
And still the thumbling tit and perky wren<br>
Popped through the tiny doors of cosy balls<br>
And the blackbird lined with moss his high-built walls;<br>
A round mud cottage held the thrush's young,<br>
And straws from the untidy sparrow's hung.<br>
And, skimming forktailed in the evening air,<br>
When man first was were not the martens there?<br>
Did not those birds some human shelter crave,<br>
And stow beneath the cornice of his cave<br>
Their dry tight cups of clay? And from each door<br>
Peeped on a morning wiseheads three or four.<br><br>

Yes, daw and owl, curlew and crested hern,<br>
Kingfisher, mallard, water-rail and tern,<br>
Chaffinch and greenfinch, warbler, stonechat, ruff,<br>
Pied wagtail, robin, fly-catcher and chough,<br>
Missel-thrush, magpie, sparrow-hawk, and jay,<br>
Built, those far ages gone, in this year's way.<br>
And the first man who walked the cliffs of Rame,<br>
As I this year, looked down and saw the same<br>
Blotches of rusty red on ledge and cleft<br>
With grey-green spots on them, while right and left<br>
A dizzying tangle of gulls were floating and flying,<br>
Wheeling and crossing and darting, crying and crying,<br>
Circling and crying, over and over and over,<br>
Crying with swoop and hover and fall and recover.<br>
And below on a rock against the grey sea fretted,<br>
Pipe-necked and stationary and silhouetted,<br>
Cormorants stood in a wise, black, equal row<br>
Above the nests and long blue eggs we know.<br><br>

O delicate chain over all the ages stretched,<br>
O dumb tradition from what far darkness fetched:<br>
Each little architect with its one design<br>
Perpetual, fixed and right in stuff and line,<br>
Each little ministrant who knows one thing,<br>
One learned rite to celebrate the spring.<br>
Whatever alters else on sea or shore,<br>
These are unchanging: man must still explore.</blockquote>

In the deep valley, and the dim Sun glowed;<br>
The clay in hard-baked fire along the hill<br>
Leapt through dark trunks to apples green and gold,<br>
Smooth, hard and cold, they shone like lamps of stone:<br><br>

They were bright bubbles bursting from the trees,<br>
Swollen and still among the dark green boughs;<br>
On their bright skins the shadows of the leaves<br>
Seemed the faint ghosts of summers long since gone,<br>
Faint ghosts of ghosts, the dreams of ghostly eyes.<br><br>

There was no sound between those breathless hills.<br>
Only the dim Sun hung there, nothing moved;<br>
The thronged, massed, crowded multitude of leaves<br>
Hung like dumb tongues that loll and gasp for air:<br>
The grass was thick and still, between the trees.<br><br>

There were big apples lying on the ground,<br>
Shining, quite still, as though they had been stunned<br>
By some great violent spirit stalking through,<br>
Leaving a deep and supernatural calm<br>
Round a dead beetle upturned in a furrow.<br><br>

A valley filled with dark, quiet, leaf-thick trees,<br>
Loaded with green, cold, faintly shining suns;<br>
And in the sky a great dim burning disc! &mdash; <br>
Madness it is to watch these twisted trunks<br>
And to see nothing move and hear no sound!<br><br>

Where dark-horned cattle stare, hoof-firm<br>

And trees are mummies swathed in sleep<br>

Soft multitudes of snow-grey clouds<br>

Of that cold spirit in the grass,<br>

Though it bear orchids and prophesying Kings,<br>
Dreams, trees, and water's bright babblings.<br><br>

It has found form and colour and light,<br>
The cold glimmer of the ice-wrapped Poles;<br>
It has called a far-off glow Arcturus,<br>
And some pale weeds, lilies of the valley.<br><br>

It has imagined Virgil, Helen and Cassandra;<br>
The sack of Troy, and the weeping for Hector &mdash; <br>
Rearing stark up 'mid all this beauty<br>

There is a dark Pine in Lapland,<br>

Moving soundlessly across the snow,<br>
Is its twin brother, double-dreamed,<br>

Gathers its shattered beauty in the sky.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>In low chalk hills the great King's body lay,<br>
And bright streams fell, tinkling like polished tin,<br>
As though they carried off his armoury,<br>
And spread it glinting through his wide domain.<br><br>

Old bearded soldiers sat and gazed dim-eyed<br>
At the strange brightness flowing under trees,<br>
And saw his sword flashing in ancient battles,<br>
And drank, and swore, and trembled helplessly.<br><br>

And bright-haired maidens dipped their cold white arms,<br>
And drew them glittering colder, whiter, still;<br>
The sky sparkled like the dead King's blue eye<br>
Upon the sentries that were dead as trees.<br><br>

His shining shield lay in an old grey town,<br>
And white swans sailed so still and dreamfully,<br>
They seemed the thoughts of those white, peaceful hills<br>
Mirrored that day within his glazing eyes.<br><br>

And in the square the pale cool butter sold,<br>
Cropped from the daisies sprinkled on the downs,<br>
And old wives cried their wares, like queer day owls,<br>
Piercing the old men's sad and foolish dreams.<br><br>

And Time flowed on till all the realm forgot<br>
The great King lying in the low chalk hills;<br>
Only the busy water dripping through<br>
His hard white bones knew of him lying there.</blockquote>

<a name="deathwj"></a><h3>Death</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>When I am dead a few poor souls shall grieve<br>
As I grieved for my brother long ago.<br>
  Scarce did my eyes grow dim,<br>
  I had forgotten him;<br>
I was far-off hearing the spring winds blow,<br>
  And many summers burned<br>
When, though still reeling with my eyes aflame,<br>
  I heard that faded name<br>
Whispered one Spring amid the hurrying world<br>
  From which, years gone, he turned.<br><br>

I looked up at my windows and I saw<br>
The trees, thin spectres sucked forth by the moon.<br>
  The air was very still<br>
  Above a distant hill;<br>
It was the hour of night's full silver moon.<br>
  'O are thou there my brother?' my soul cried;<br>
And all the pale stars down bright rivers wept,<br>
  As my heart sadly crept<br>
About the empty hills, bathed in that light<br>
  That lapped him when he died.<br><br>

Ah! it was cold, so cold; do I not know<br>
How dead my heart on that remembered day!<br>
  Clear in a far-away place<br>
  I see his delicate face<br>
Just as he called me from my solitary play,<br>
  Giving into my hands a tiny tree.<br>
We planted it in the dark, blossomless ground<br>
  Gravely, without a sound;<br>
Then back I went and left him standing by<br>
  His birthday gift to me.<br>
<br>
In that far land perchance it quietly grows<br>
Drinking the rain, making a pleasant shade;<br>
  Birds in its branches fly<br>
  Out of the fathomless sky<br>
Where worlds of circling light arise and fade.<br>
  Blindly it quivers in the bright flood of day,<br>
Or drowned in multitudinous shouts of rain<br>
  Glooms o'er the dark-veiled plain &mdash; <br>
Buried below, the ghost that's in his bones<br>
  Dreams in the sodden clay.<br><br>

And, while he faded, drunk with beauty's eyes<br>
I kissed bright girls and laughed deep in dumb trees,<br>
  That stared fixt in the air<br>
  Like madmen in despair<br>
Gaped up from earth with the escaping breeze.<br>
  I saw earth's exaltation slowly creep<br>
Out of their myriad sky-embracing veins.<br>
  I laughed along the lanes,<br>
Meeting Death riding in from the hollow seas<br>
  Through black-wreathed woods asleep.<br><br>

I laughed, I swaggered on the cold hard ground &mdash; <br>
Through the grey air trembled a falling wave &mdash; <br>
  'Thou'rt pale, O Death!' I cried,<br>
  Mocking him in my pride;<br>
And passing I dreamed not of that lonely grave,<br>
But of leaf-maidens whose pale, moon-like hands<br>
Above the tree-foam waved in the icy air,<br>
  Sweeping with shining hair<br>
Through the green-tinted sky, one moment fled<br>
  Out of immortal lands.<br><br>

One windless Autumn night the Moon came out   <br>
In a white sea of cloud, a field of snow;      <br>
  In darkness shaped of trees,<br>
  I sank upon my knees<br>
And watched her shining, from the small wood below &mdash; <br>
  Faintly Death flickered in an owl's far cry &mdash; -<br>
We floated soundless in the great gulf of space,<br>
  Her light upon my face &mdash; <br>
Immortal, shining in that dark wood I knelt<br>
  And knew I could not die.<br><br>

And knew I could not die &mdash; O Death, didst thou<br>
Heed my vain glory, standing pale by thy dead?<br>
  There is a spirit who grieves<br>
  Amid earth's dying leaves;<br>
Was't thou that wept beside my brother's bed?<br>
  For I did never mourn nor heed at all<br>
Him passing on his temporal elm-wood bier;<br>
  I never shed a tear.<br>
The drooping sky spread grey-winged through my soul,<br>
  While stones and earth did fall.<br><br>

That sound rings down the years &mdash; I hear it yet &mdash; <br>
All earthly life's a winding funeral &mdash; <br>
  And though I never wept,<br>
  But into the dark coach stept,<br>
Dreaming by night to answer the blood's sweet call,<br>
  She who stood there, high-breasted, with small, wise lips,<br>
And gave me wine to drink and bread to eat,<br>
  Has not more steadfast feet,<br>
But fades from my arms as fade from mariners' eyes<br>
  The sea's most beauteous ships.<br><br>

The trees and hills of earth were once as close<br>
As my own brother, they are becoming dreams<br>
  And shadows in my eyes;<br>
  More dimly lies<br>
Guaya deep in my soul, the coastline gleams<br>
  Faintly along the darkening crystalline seas.<br>
Glimmering and lovely still, 'twill one day go;<br>
  The surging dark will flow<br>
Over my hopes and joys, and blot out all<br>
  Earth's hills and skies and trees.<br><br>

I shall look up one night and see the Moon<br>
For the last time shining above the hills,<br>
  And thou, silent, wilt ride<br>
  Over the dark hillside.<br>
'Twill be, perchance, the time of daffodils &mdash; <br>
  <i>'How come those bright immortals in the woods?<br>
Their joy being young, didst thou not drag them all<br>
  Into dark graves ere Fall?'</i><br>
Shall life thus haunt me, wondering, as I go<br>
  To thy deep solitudes?<br><br>

There is a figure with a down-turned torch<br>
Carved on a pillar in an olden time,<br>
  A calm and lovely boy<br>
  Who comes not to destroy<br>
But to lead age back to its golden prime.<br>
  Thus did an antique sculptor draw thee, Death,<br>
With smooth and beauteous brow and faint sweet smile,<br>
  Not haggard, gaunt and vile,<br>
And thou perhaps art thus to whom men may,<br>
  Unvexed, give up their breath.<br><br>

But in my soul thou sittest like a dream<br>
Among earth's mountains, by her dim-coloured seas;<br>
  A wild unearthly Shape<br>
  In thy dark-glimmering cape,<br>
Piping a tune of wavering melodies,<br>
  Thou sittest, ay, thou sittest at the feast<br>
Of my brief life among earth's bright-wreathed flowers,<br>
  Staining the dancing hours<br>
With sombre gleams until, abrupt, thou risest<br>
And all, at once, is ceased.

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Georgian Poetry 1918-19, by Various

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GEORGIAN POETRY 1918-19 ***

This file should be named 8gp0410h.htm or 8gp0410h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, 8gp0411h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 8gp0410ah.htm

Produced by Keren Vergon, Clytie Siddall and PG Distributed Proofreaders

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
